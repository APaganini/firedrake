Firedrake '18
-------------
               
We are very happy to announce that
the second Firedrake user and developer workshop will be held on 7
and 8 June 2018.

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to spend face to
face time with developers and other users.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

The workshop will start with a half day Firedrake tutorial for
interested new users and the main science programme will start at lunchtime on 7 June.

Key Dates
---------

* Early registration deadline: 10 April 2018

Call for submissions

We invite contributions in either oral or poster form from Firedrake
users and developers on any aspect of Firedrake and its application.
Contributions might include new classes of problem tackled with
Firedrake, any new discretisations made available, new features in the
