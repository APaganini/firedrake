The :doc:`Firedrake project <index>` is proud to host the 2015 FEniCS
Workshop. The workshop is an opportunity for all those interested the
`FEniCS Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_, and related projects such
as `dolfin-adjoint <http://dolfin-adjoint>`_ and :doc:`Firedrake
<index>` to exchange ideas, communicate their results and network with
the automated finite element community.

The workshop welcomes existing and potential developers and users of
automated simulation systems, as well as mathematicians interested in
engaging with applications via automated code generation.

Programme
---------

The workshop will run from Monday afternoon until the end of
Wednesday. This should allow for plenty of talk slots as well as a lot
of time for discussions in smaller and larger groups.
