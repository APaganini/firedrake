Firedrake '17
-------------
               
We are very happy to announce that
the first Firedrake user and developer workshop will be held on 27
and 28 March 2017.

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to spend face to
face time with developers and other users.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

The workshop will start with a half day Firedrake tutorial for
interested new users and the main science programme will start at lunchtime on 27 March.

Key Dates
---------

* Early registration deadline: 10 February 2017
* Abstract deadline: 10 February 2017

Call for submissions
--------------------

We invite contributions in oral or poster form from Firedrake users
and developers on any aspect of Firedrake and its
application. Contributions might cover new classes of problems tackled
with Firedrake, new discretisations made available, new features of
the compilation pipeline or new technology at the linear and nonlinear
solver stage.
 
Please consider how your contribution could help other users achieve
more with Firedrake, and also how Firedrake could be developed to
further facilitate your science goals.
